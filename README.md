# Python
Home of python modules I've created... ready for import and implement however you will!

Here you will find scripts, programs, modules, all teh things.  Some useful, some WTF, and some oh cool but impractical.

THey should all be pretty self-explanatory.  And of course, fully reviewable.

## And just in case they're not:

* clientlist.py - module; creates an clientlist object.  Works with a filesystem-persistent file, the client list.  The list is ordered.  You have the ability to add/remove clients to/from the list, print the list, return the list, compare add/remove changes made to the list since it was loaded at runtime, and save it back to the persistent filesystem.   Requires a directory called "data" to reside in the same directory as file being executed from.
* ColorPrompt.py - module; creates a printing object.  Either print in a unified manner or prompt the user for an input, return the input after sanitizing for type specified.
