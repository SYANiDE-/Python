# Python
Home of python scripts/modules

Here you will find scripts, programs, modules, all teh things.  Some useful, some WTF, and some oh cool but impractical.

They should all be pretty self-explanatory.  And of course, fully reviewable.

### But just in case they're not:

* bgrab.py - a simple banner-grabbing program.  Optionally runs nmap against your target if your initial port isn't open.
